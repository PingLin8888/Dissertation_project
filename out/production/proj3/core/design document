Design Document Sections
1. Classes and Data Structures
Include here any class definitions. For each class, list the instance variables (if any). Include a
brief description of each variable and its purpose in the class.

class: room

shape???
width
height

location



class: hallways
width: 1
length: random

hasTurn

direction(horizontal, ,,

blocation



2. Algorithms
This is where you describe how your code works. For each class, include a high-level description of
the methods in that class. That is, do not include a line-by-line breakdown of your code, but something you would write in a javadoc comment above a method, including any edge cases you are accounting for.

random numbers of rooms and hallways???? these two must be seperated in different classes




3. Persistence
You should only tackle this section after you are done with 3A. This section should describe how you
are going to save the state of a world, and load it again, following the requirements in the spec.
Again, try to keep your explanations clear and short. Include all the components your program
interacts with - classes, specific methods, and files you may create. You can check out lab 11.
